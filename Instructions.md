BlueGigaEmpeg Instructions
===============================================================================

Congratulations to you, owner of a shiny new BlueGigaEmpeg module!

Your full detailed instructions are located online here:
- https://github.com/tfabris/BlueGigaEmpeg/blob/master/README.md

Please carefully go through the "Checklist" in that document, the required
modifications to your empeg are detailed there. In the meantime, please
remember this:

- Do not plug the BlueGigaEmpeg module into the empeg Car docking sled until
  the modifications described in README.md have been completed. Damage may
  occur if you plug it in before everything is ready.
  
Thank you, and enjoy your new toy!

Tony
